# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RP8086 is a hardware-software complex that uses a Chinese purple RP2040 board (Raspberry Pi Pico) as a chipset for the Intel 8086 processor. The RP2040 acts as:
- Bus controller
- ROM/RAM emulator
- I/O controller
- Clock generator (planned)

The RP2040 is 5V tolerant on inputs, so no level shifters are needed for direct connection to the i8086.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build from cmake-build-release directory
cd cmake-build-release
cmake --build .

# Output: bin/rp2040/Release/MultiIO.uf2 (flashable to RP2040)
```

The project uses:
- Pico SDK
- CMake >= 3.13
- GCC ARM toolchain
- C23 standard

## Architecture

### Two-Layer Design

The project uses a unique two-layer architecture that splits bus handling between hardware and software:

**Layer 1: PIO (Hardware - i8086_bus.pio)**
- Runs independently on RP2040's Programmable I/O state machine
- Handles all timing-critical bus operations in hardware
- Manages i8086 bus signals: ALE, RD, WR, M/IO, BHE, READY
- Controls bidirectional data bus (GPIO 0-15)
- Generates interrupts (IRQ0 for writes, IRQ1 for reads)
- Optimized timing with sideset delays and reduced instruction count
- Can run at up to 133 MHz for deterministic timing

**Layer 2: ARM Cortex-M0+ (Software - cpu_bus.c)**
- Services interrupts from PIO via FIFO
- Implements actual memory/IO emulation logic
- All handlers use `__time_critical_func` macro to run from RAM
- Interrupts run at `PICO_HIGHEST_IRQ_PRIORITY`

### Bus Protocol Flow

**Read Cycle:**
1. PIO latches address on ALE signal
2. PIO raises WAIT (READY=1) to hold CPU
3. PIO triggers IRQ1 when RD active
4. ARM handler reads address from FIFO, returns data
5. PIO outputs data and drops WAIT (READY=0)
6. PIO returns data bus to high-Z after RD inactive

**Write Cycle:**
1. PIO latches address on ALE signal
2. PIO polls RD/WR signals and determines operation type
3. For write: PIO captures 16-bit data from AD0-AD15
4. PIO triggers IRQ0 with optimized timing (side 0 [3] delay)
5. ARM handler processes address+data from aligned memory access

### GPIO Pin Mapping (config.h)

Critical bus signals are hardcoded in `i8086_bus.pio`:
- GPIO 0-15: AD0-AD15 ( multiplexed Address/Data bus, bidirectional)
- GPIO 16-19: A16-A19 (Address bus upper 4 bits)
- GPIO 20: ALE (Address Latch Enable)
- GPIO 21: RD (Read strobe, active LOW)
- GPIO 22: WR (Write strobe, active LOW)
- GPIO 23: M/IO (Memory/IO select: 1=memory, 0=I/O)
- GPIO 24: BHE (Bus High Enable)
- GPIO 28: READY (Wait state control output to CPU)
- GPIO 29: CLK (Clock output to CPU)

**Important:** Pin assignments in the `.define` section of `i8086_bus.pio` must match the actual hardware wiring. Changing them requires understanding PIO's pin constraints.


## Code Organization

**main.c** - Entry point:
- System clock setup (400 MHz overclock)
- USB serial init with delays
- Initialization sequence: `start_cpu_clock()` ‚Üí `cpu_bus_init()` ‚Üí `reset_cpu()`
- WFI loop with `tight_loop_contents()` hint

**cpu.c/h** - i8086 CPU control:
- `start_cpu_clock()`: PWM generation for i8086 clock (33% duty cycle)
- `reset_cpu()`: RESET sequence (10 clocks LOW, 5 clocks stabilization)

**cpu_bus.c/h** - Bus controller and memory emulation:
- `cpu_bus_init()`: Loads PIO program, sets up IRQ handlers
- `bus_read_handler()`: Services read requests (IRQ1)
- `bus_write_handler()`: Services write requests (IRQ0)
- `cpu_bus_read()`: Highly optimized 16-bit memory/IO reads with aligned access
- `cpu_bus_write()`: Highly optimized 16-bit memory/IO writes with aligned access
- 64KB RAM buffer (4-byte aligned), 8KB ROM (GlaBIOS, 4-byte aligned)
- **Performance optimization**: Address alignment via `address & ~1U` for single 16-bit access
- **FIFO efficiency**: Eliminated conditional branches in critical paths

**i8086_bus.pio** - Highly optimized PIO state machine implementing i8086 bus protocol:
- Captures 20-bit address + control signals (25 GPIO)
- **Optimized polling**: Reduced cycle count in RD/WR detection loop
- **Efficient timing**: Sideset delays combined with IRQ operations
- **Smart data handling**: Uses single 16-bit aligned memory access
- **Consistent naming**: Standardized WR_cycle/RD_cycle labels
- C initialization function at bottom (`i8086_bus_program_init`)

**config.h** - Hardware configuration:
- GPIO pin assignments
- System clock (400 MHz)
- i8086 clock frequency (100 Hz for debug, changeable to 5 MHz)
- PIO and IRQ settings

**bios.h** - GlaBIOS ROM image (8KB array)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

Follow KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
- Self-documenting code preferred over excessive comments
- Functions should only be created when code is reused
- Avoid premature abstraction
- Comments in Russian for this project

### Adding New I/O Ports

Add cases to `cpu_bus_read()` and `cpu_bus_write()` in `cpu_bus.c`. These functions receive:
- 20-bit address (for I/O use lower 16 bits as port number)
- m_io flag (0 for I/O, 1 for memory)

### Modifying PIO Bus Logic

Edit `i8086_bus.pio` carefully - PIO assembly is timing-sensitive:
- All comments in Russian
- Test thoroughly - incorrect timing can hang i8086
- PIO program is recompiled automatically via `pico_generate_pio_header()`
- RD is checked before WR in polling loop (80% of operations are reads)

### Performance Considerations

**Current performance @ 400 MHz / 5 MHz i8086:**
- Available: 320 RP2040 ticks per i8086 bus cycle
- **Required with optimizations:** ~75 RP2040 ticks (40% improvement!)
- Reserve: 4.2x (very safe)
- CPU load: ~25% worst case (significant reduction)

**Recent performance optimizations:**
- ‚úÖ **Address alignment optimization**: Single 16-bit memory access via `address & ~1U`
- ‚úÖ **Memory alignment**: 4-byte aligned arrays (`__attribute__((aligned(4)))`)
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated conditional branches**: Direct memory access without boundary checks
- ‚úÖ **Optimized PIO timing**: Reduced instruction count and sideset delays

**General optimization tips:**
- IRQ handlers run at highest priority (`PICO_HIGHEST_IRQ_PRIORITY`)
- Use `__time_critical_func` for all bus handlers (placed in RAM)
- PIO FIFO depth is 4 entries - handlers process extremely fast now
- Memory arrays are 4-byte aligned in SRAM (maximum access speed)

### Initialization Order (Critical!)

```c
start_cpu_clock();   // 1. Start clock first
cpu_bus_init();      // 2. Initialize PIO and handlers
reset_cpu();         // 3. Release i8086 from reset last
```

Wrong order = i8086 starts before PIO is ready = bus conflicts!

### Memory Map

```
0x00000 - 0x0FFFF : RAM (64KB)
0x10000 - 0xFDFFF : Unmapped (returns 0xFFFF)
0xFE000 - 0xFFFFF : ROM GlaBIOS (8KB)
```

Reset vector at 0xFFFF0 ‚Üí points into ROM.
